# CitiBike

The objective of this project was to design an Abstract Data Type (ADT) to model a bicycle usage analyzer for New York's CitiBike system. The analysis tool will allow authorities to define the points of receipt and take-up of bicycles, as well as those who wish to understand the different collection and drop-off points for bicycles registered in the system. Data structures, especially graphs, were used to answer queries in the shortest possible time.
